I joined up for the first hour of the QGIS workshop, and while I couldn't stay as long as I would have liked, I at least managed to download (with some difficulties) the program and get it installed. We got through opening three layers and pulling in the background map before I had to get to my next class. After that I was hoping I could easily find the video of the workshop. Sadly, I could not, so I'll be asking you for help about this. As is my tradition. 

Getting back in the GIS spirit friday night, I dug into the mapathon and ended up mapping buildings in Open Street Map as a 'high urgency' project in Kingston, Jamaica.  Pulling up OSM, i click on the 'area' polygon tool and mark out boxes on the extremely grainy satellite photo of an important part of town that nevertheless seems to have a lot of shanties and informal housing. I thought i could just mark the buildings and be done with it, but apparently it's necessary to provide each polygon with a tag. Not knowing what the buildings are, i had to default to "yes" instead of anything actually helpful.
