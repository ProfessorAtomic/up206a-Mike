I read up on wall street landlords, a report written by Tenants Together (an SF-based Tenants' Organizer). The link is here: https://www.tenantstogether.org/sites/tenantstogether.org/files/California%20Wall%20St%20Landlords%20in%202019.pdf
They wanted to map out the corporate landlords that own properties in California; though the rate of corporate purchasing slowed from 2015 to 2019, it jumped sharply in two new metros, Modesto and Bakersfield. Nowhere in the state did it decline in any way, large-portfolio landlords continue to corner a significant share of the housing market. The authors note that corporate landlords tend to charge more, provide less maintenance, and create more barriers to service than mom and pop landlords. 
I came from tenants advocacy, and this report grabbed me since I know the authors. Corporate landlording has exploded in the post-recession market, driving up rents and eating away at the character of our cities. I hadn't realized that they actually charged more for the same housing services. My upcoming covid recovery group project has me thinking about two necessities that need to be reexamined - housing and child care - and this kind of report is emblematic of the problems with the profit motive, namely the incumbency bias of wealth.
