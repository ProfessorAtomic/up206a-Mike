What spoke to me was the familiarity of seeing some of these concepts rolled out by a talk put on by Millard-Ball and his terrific accent last year. Not being any kind of expert on the topic, it does seem that this moment of urban planning education centers critique of planning's racialized/classist/segregative roots. Boeing's peek into the 'vintage' of street design tells us that postmodern planners were wholly concerned with ease of driving, though the clutch point of dependency on the automobile may have in the moment been imperceptible. I'm glad that the trends are reversing, though our downtowns are fully built out, the coming state shift in american climate liveability may promote new downtowns (what a thoroughly depressing thought). 

Either way, I'm not sure yet how these tools can be brought to bear on my own research because I don't really know what's going to get researched yet. I'm still in the world of the unknown unknown. But i will say the second article - on his research, rather than the one on the tool he developed to perform said research, was far more readable and accessible - since it wasn't a technical document. 

The OSMnx seems more oriented toward transportation studies, so i would like to know how it might be used for studying people - demographics, housing prices, changes over time, and so on.
