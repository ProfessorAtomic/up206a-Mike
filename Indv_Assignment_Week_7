I saw the talk that Soon-to-be-Professor Millard-Ball (lover of hyphens) presented last year on the topic of the first paper in your list, and wanted to read over it with my fledgling understanding of GIS (or at least my awareness of the bigness of GIS and its vast capacity to infuriate). It's a fascinating topic that led me to understand that, with certain extreme exceptions, a road is forever. Open Street map seemed only to be mentioned in passing a few times, as well as the tantalizing tidbit about 'calculating all of the intersections in the world'. My question is... how? How can we use any program to account for every iteration of any one category on earth? They were so cavalier about mentioning crunching every intersection on the planet as a data point that I wonder how many there could be and how you account for them all. It's mostly a daunting topic of scale. There's a certain simplicity to the way that intersections can occur, so that at least seems digestible, but it still baffles me how we can ask Open Street Map for a list of everything.
