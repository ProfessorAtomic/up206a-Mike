Hey all! Psyched to be in a class that genuinely baffles and terrifies me. Everything else seems so easy in comparison. 
Serious stuff: I come from tenants' advocacy and general lefty activism, study topics of interest are displacement, child care systems*, housing affordability, state and local government, and vote dilution. 
Fun stuff: I'm the proud but beleaguered father of toddler Sydney, who keeps putting food in her hair. Punk rock, baking, biking, and the Nintendo Switch are my treasured outlets. 
Let's change the world because no one else will.
